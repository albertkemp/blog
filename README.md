# Albert Kemp's blog
I'm Albert and I like airplanes, programming, computers and Chinese food and culture.
This is my blog where I share my interests.

Expect to find airplane, airline and programming languages and blog posts about planes, airlines, programming, Chinese food and culture and technology in general.
